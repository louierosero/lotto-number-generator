# Lotto Generated Number
The Lotto Generated Number is a simple feature designed to help users generate a set of numbers for a specific Lotto Draw. With just one click, users can generate a random number between 1 and the maximum number specified for the lotto draw

## How it Works
When the user selects a specific lotto draw (e.g., 6/45), they can click on the "GENERATE NUMBER" button to generate a number. The generated number is displayed at the top of the page in ascending order to avoid confusion when the user writes the numbers down on their lotto paper.

The website also displays which lotto draws will be taking place on the current day. This ensures that users are updated on the lotto draws that they can participate in on that particular day.

## Benefits
The Lotto Generated Number feature simplifies the process of playing the lotto and enhances the user's experience. It saves time and effort for the user, as they do not have to manually select their own numbers. It also eliminates the possibility of human error in selecting the numbers.
